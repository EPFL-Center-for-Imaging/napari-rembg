### Why use `napari-rembg`?
- It runs **fast** even on a laptop's CPU (a few seconds per image).
- It is **easy to install** compared to other AI tools for segmentation.
- It is a **quick and easy** solution to automatically extract the foreground of scientific and natural images.

This plugin is primarily intended for analyzing **2D** and **2D (RGB)** images, however it can also be used to segment a particular slice in a **2D + time**, **2D + channel** or **3D** image.

## Installation

You can install `napari-rembg` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-rembg

## Usage

Start `napari-rembg` from the `Plugins` menu of Napari:

```
Plugins > Select foreground (napari-rembg)
```

**Regions of Interest**

You can insert a `Shapes` layer and **draw a rectangle** to define a Region of Interest (ROI) in which to run the foreground selection. Make sure to have only *a single rectangle* drawn in the `Shapes` layer ðŸ˜‰.

*Minor issue*: until [#5505](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/5505) is fixed it won't be possible to use ROIs drawn in planes other than the default (XY).

**Multiple objects selection**

You can select the `Labels` layer in which to write the output of the foreground segmentation. The output label of the foreground will be the selected label of that `Labels` layer. This makes it possible to run the foreground selection multiple times (e.g. along different channels or in multiple ROIs) and to combine the results in a single `Labels` layer.
